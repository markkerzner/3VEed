3VEed
=====

This project is for processing modern-day document streams, characterized by 3V's: variety, velocity and volume.
It is based on Storm. The first practical use case is eDiscovery, where you have files of all sizes and types that do not fit batch paradigm.
Hence the name, which stands for 3V Electronic Evidence Discovery. However, it will work for multiple types of loads and applications. 
The batch version of the same is called FreeEed and is found right here, https://github.com/markkerzner/FreeEed.

Capabilities (current and future)

* processing 300+ file types using Tika
* indexing text extracted from Office and other formats
* OCR
* search with Solr and Lucene
